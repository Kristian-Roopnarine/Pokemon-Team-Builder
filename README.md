The start of something new.

# What do

Playing pokemon competitively is extremely complicated. You have to create a team of 6 pokemon out of nearly **898 unique pokemon** (as of December 6th 2021). This **does not include** the 35 different regional forms, and 48 mega evolutions, and 32 Gigantamax forms. Then each pokemon can **learn 4 moves out each out of the current available 826 pokemon moves**. 

When creating a pokemon team you want to have the best combination of 6 pokemon that can stand their ground against the other 892 pokemon...which is nearly impossible. Not to mention we can slightly alter the distribution of pokemon stats to make them more durable, or hit harder, which only adds to the complexity of creating a team.
