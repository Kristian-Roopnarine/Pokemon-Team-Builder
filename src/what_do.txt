Problem trying to solve: Make a persons life easier when they are trying to create a pokemon team by providing the weaknesses of the current team.

How work (v1) - At first will start will one pokemon.
1. User enters a pokemon that they want on their team.
2. The application will output:
    1. All pokemon that have a type advantage over the current pokemon
    2. All pokemon that can learn a pokemon move that has a type advantage over the current pokemon
3. Output as excel/text file.


Things to consider:
1. Where are we getting the pokemon data?
    1. Possibly scrape from serebii
    2. Pretty sure there's a database with the data already
    Possible Solutions:
    1. pokemondb.net/pokedex/all - This has the Pokemon number, name, type, total and base stats
    2. pokemondb.net/move/all - This is the total list of all attacks
        - What's the best way to create a relationship between pokemon and their attacks?
            - When you click on a move on pokemondb.net, it shows all pokemon that can learn that move!
    
Possible solutions:
1. Might have to scrape this from pokemondb.net

2. Are we going to store the pokemon data?
    1. If so - Database? Local file storage?
3. Where is the user going to input the first pokemon? 
    1. Command line
    2. GUI
    3. Web application
