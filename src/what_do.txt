Problem trying to solve: Make a persons life easier when they are trying to create a pokemon team by providing the weaknesses of the current team.

How work (v1) - At first will start will one pokemon.
1. User enters a pokemon that they want on their team.
2. The application will output:
    1. All pokemon that have a type advantage over the current pokemon
    2. All pokemon that can learn a pokemon move that has a type advantage over the current pokemon
3. Output as excel/text file.

Problems to consider for v1:
1. Where are we getting the pokemon data?
2. Are we going to store the pokemon data?
    1. If so - Database? Local file storage?
3. Where is the user going to input the first pokemon? 
    1. Command line
    2. GUI
    3. Web application


Decisions for v1 (December 6th):
1. Will scrape the data from multiple places:  
    1. pokemondb.net/pokdex/all - for the list of pokemon
    2. pokemondb.net/move/all - for the list of all pokemon moves
        - navigating to pokemondb.net/move/<pokemon_move> will list out the pokemon that can learn this move through eggs, tm, tr or levelling
2. Local CSV for now
3. Command line

TO DO for v1 (December 6th):
1. Get all the pokemon data into a csv file
    - Scrape the pokemondb.net/podekex/all for all the pokemon data
    - Save in CSV file
2. Create command line script 
    - Get user input for one pokemon
    - Cross reference every pokemon that is strong vs pokemon inputted
        - Will need pokemon type chart for this
